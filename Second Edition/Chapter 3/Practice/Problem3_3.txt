Each of the following lines of code generates an error message
when we invoke the assembler. Explain what is wrong with each
line.

A) movb $0xf, (%b1)
The only registers that can be used as address registers are long word ones, so we cannot use %b1.

B) movl %ax, (%esp)
Mismatch between instruction suffix and register ID

C) movw (%eax), 4(%esp)
Cannot have both source and destination be memory references

D) movb %ah, %sh
Register %sh does not exist in x86.

E) movl %eax, $0x123
Cannot have a constant as a destination


F) movl %eax, %dx
%dx cannot store the contents of %eax as it is a 2 byte register.

G) movb %si, 8(%ebp)
Mismatch between instruction suffix and register ID.
