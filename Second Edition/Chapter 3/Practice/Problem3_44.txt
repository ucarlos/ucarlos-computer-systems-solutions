Running our stack-checking code 10,000 times on a system running
Linux version 2.6.16, we obtained addresses ranging from a
minimum of 0xffffb754 to a maximum of 0xffffd754

A) What is the approximate range of addresses?
   0xffffd754 - 0xffffb754 = 0x2000 -- 0010 0000 0000 0000
   == 2^12  addresses.

B) If we attempted a buffer overrun with a 128-byte nop sled,
   how many attempts would it take to exhaustively test all
   starting addresses. 2^12 - 2^7 = 2^5 attempts, so
   32 attempts.
