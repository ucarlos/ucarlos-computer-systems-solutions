It is common to find assembly code lines of the form

xorl  %edx, %edx

in code that was generated from C where no exclusive-or operations were
present.

A) Explain the effect of this particular exclusive-or instruction and what
useful operation it implements.
It clears a register by setting every bit to zero.


B) What would be the more straightforward way to express this operation in
assembly code?

Moving a constant zero to a register such as:
movl $0, %edx



C) Compare the number of bytes to encode these two different implementations of
the same operation.
Apparently, assembling and disassembling this code the xorl commands requires 2 bytes while using movl requires 5.
