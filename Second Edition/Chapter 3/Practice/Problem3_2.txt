For each of the following lines of assembly language, determine
the appropriate instruction suffix based on the operands.
(For example, mov can be rewritten as movb, movw, or movl.)

1) mov %eax, (%esp)
   movl

2) mov (%eax), %dx
   movw

3) mov $0xff, %bl
   movb

4) mov (%esp, %edx, 4), %dh
   movb

5) push $0xff
   pushl

6) mov %dx, (%eax)
   movb

7) pop %edi
   popl
