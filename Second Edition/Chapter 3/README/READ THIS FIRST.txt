There are some differences between IA32 and x86-64 that have to addressed.
The following pictures should help:

1) cmp instructions are different in x86-64 than in IA32.

in IA32, the instructions
cmpl $1, %edx
jle .L1

would state that 1 and %edx are being compared, and if 1 <= %edx, there is a 
branch to .L1

in x86-64, the instructions would be this:
cmpq $1, %rdx
jle .L1

which would compare 1 and %rdx, but would branch WHEN %rdx <= 1.
