Suppose we are given the task of generating code to multiply integer varibale x by various different constant factors K. To be efficient, we want to use only the operations +, -, and <<. For the following values of K, write C expressions to perform the multiplication using at MOST three operations per expressions


where v is a variable
A) K == 17
(K << 4) + K

B) K == -7
K - (K << 3)

C) K == 60
(K << 6) - (K << 3)

D) K == -112
(K << 4) - (K << 7)
