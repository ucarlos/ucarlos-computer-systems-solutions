/*
 * Following the bit-level floating-point coding rules, implement the function
 * with the following prototype:
 * // Compute 2 * f. If f is NaN, then return f.
 * float_bits float_twice(float_bits f);
 *
 * For floating-point number f, this function computes 2.0 * f. If f is NaN,
 * your function should simply return f.
 *
 * Test your function by evaluating it for all 2^32 values of argument f and 
 * comparing the result to what would be obtained using your machine's 
 * floating-point operations.
