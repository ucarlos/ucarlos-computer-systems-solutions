    The imprecision floating-point arithmetic can have disatrous
effects. On February 25, 1991, during the first Gulf War, an
American Patriot Missle battery in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, failed
to intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missle. The Scud struck an
American Army barracks and killed 28 soldiers. The U.S General
Accounting Office(GAO) conducted a detailed analysis of the
failure and determined that the underlying cause was
imprecision in a numeric calculation. In this exercise,
you wil reproduce part of the GAO's analysis.

     The Patriot systems contains an internal clock, implemented as a counter that is incremented every 0.1 seconds. To Determine the time in seconds, the program would multiply the value of this counter by a 24-bit quantity that was a fractional binary approximation to 1/10. In particular, the binary representation of 1/0 is the nonterminating sequence 0.000110011[0011]..., where the portion in brackets is repreated indefinitely. The program approximated 0.1, as a value x, by considering just the first 23 bits of the sequence to thr right of the binary point:
     x = 0.00011001100110011001100
    ~x = 1.11100110011001100110100 

A) What is the Binary representation of 0.1 - x?
   0.00011001100110011001100
   1.11100110011001100110100
   ----------------------------
   0.00000000000000000000100

B) What is the Decimal representation of 0.1 - x?
   x = 0.00011001100110011001100
   so x == 0 + 1/2^4 + 1/2^5 + 1/2^8 + 1/2^9 + 1/2^12 + 1/2^13 + 1/2^16 + 1/2^17 + 1/2^20 + 1/2^21
    == 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/256 + 1/512 + 1/4096 + 1/8192 + 1/65536 + 1/131072 + 1/1048576 + 1/2097152

C) The clock starts at 0 when the system is first powered up and keeps counting up from there. In this case, the susyem had been running for around 100 hours. What was the fdifference between the actual time and the time computed by the software?




D) The system predicts where an incoming missile will appear based on its velocity and the time of the last radar detection. Given that a Scud travels at around 2000 meters per second, how far off was its prediction?




Side Note:
Normally, a slight error in the absolute time reported by a clock reading would not affect a tracking computation. Instead, it should depend on the realtiove time between two successive readings. The problem was that the Patriot software had been upgraded to use a more accuratew funmction for reading time, but not all the function calls had been replaced by the new code. As a result, the tracking software used the accurate time for one reading and the inaccurate time for the other.
