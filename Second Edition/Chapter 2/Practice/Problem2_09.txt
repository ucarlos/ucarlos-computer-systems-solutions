Computers generate color picture on a video screen or liquid crystal display by mixing three
different colors of light: red, green, and vlue. Imagine a simple scheme, with three different
lights, each of which can be turned on or off, projecting onto a glass screen.

We can then create eight different colors based on the absence(0) or presensene(1) of light
sources R, G, and B:


R    G    B    Color
---------------------
0    0    0    Black
0    0	  1    Blue
0    1	  0    Green
0    1	  1    Cyan
1    0	  0    Red
1    0	  1    Magenta
1    1	  0    Yellow
1    1	  1    White
---------------------

Each of these colors can be represented as a bit vector of length 3, and we can apply Boolean
operations to them.


A) The complement of a color is formed by turning off the lights that are on and turning on the
   lights that are off. What would be the complement of each of the eight colors listed above?

B) Describe the effect of applying Boolean operations on the following colors:

   Blue | Green = -->  001 | 010 --> 011 (Cyan)
   Yellow & Cyan = --> 110 & 011 --> 010(Green)
   Red ^ Magenta = --> 100 ^ 101 --> 001(Blue)
