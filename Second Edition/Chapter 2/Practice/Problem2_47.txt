Consider a 5-bit floating point representation based on the IEEE floating-point
format, with one sign bit, two exponent bits (k = 2), and two fraction
bits (n = 2). The exponent vias is 2^(2 - 1 ) - 1 = 1.
     The table that follows enumerates the entire nonegative range for this
     5-bit floating-point representation. Fill in the blank table entries using
     the following directions:

     e: The value represented by considering the exponent field to be an
     unsigned integer.

     E: The value of the exponent after biasing
     2^E:The numeric weight of the exponent
     f: The value of the fraction
     M: The value of the significand (Mantissa)
     2^E X M: The (unreduced fractional value of the number)
     V: The reduced fractional value of the numbre
     Decimal: The decimal representation of the number
