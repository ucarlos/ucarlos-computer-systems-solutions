Using only bit-level and logical operations, write a C
expression that is equivalent to x == y. In other words, it will
return 1 when x and y are equal, and 0 otherwise.

The expression is:
!(x ^ y),, which will be true if x and y are both 0 or 1.
 

x y  XOR    XNOR
0 0   0      1
0 1   1      0
1 0   1      0
1 1   0      1
