Write C expressions, in terms of variable x, for the following values. Your code should work
for any word size >= 8. For reference, we show the result of evaluating the expressions for
x = 0x87654321, with w = 32.

A) The least significant byte of x, with all other bits set to 0. [0x00000021]
   For w  = 32, we have x &= 000000FF

B) At but the least significant of x complemented, with the least significant byte
   left unchanged. [0x789ABC21]
   	For w = 32, we have x = (~x) ^ 0x000000FF

C) The least significant byte set to all ones, and all other bytes of x left unchanged [0x876543FF]

   For w = 32, we have x |= 000000FF
