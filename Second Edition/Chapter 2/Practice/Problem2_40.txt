For each of the following values of K, find ways to express x * K using
only the specified number of operations, where we consider both additions
and substractions to have comparable cost. You may need to use some tricks
beyond the simple form A and B rules we have considered so far.

K      Shifts	  Add/Subs     Expression
6      2	  1	       (x << 2) + (x << 1)
31     1	  1	       (x << 5) - 1
-6     2	  1	       (x << 1) - (x << 3)
55     2	  2	       (x << 6) - (x << 3)  - 1
