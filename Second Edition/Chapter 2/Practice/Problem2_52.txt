Consider the following two 7-bit floating-point representation based on the
IEEE floating point format. Neither has a sign bit -- They can only represent
nonnegative numbers.

1. Format A
   There are k = 3 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 3.
   There are n = 4 fraction bits.

2. Format B
   There are k = 4 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 7.
   There are n = 4 fraction bits.

Below, you are given some bit patterns in Format A, and your task is to convert
them to the closest value in Format B. If necessary, you should apply the
round-to even rounding rule. IN addition, give the values of numbers given by
the Format A and Format B bit patterns. Give these as whole numbers (e.g 17) or
as fractions (e.g 17/64).
